## Complex Kotlin Extra Credit: Seneca the Younger

### Pt I -- Who's Seneca the Younger?

Hey, my Classics Minor is finally paying off! :P

Seneca the Younger (commonly just called Seneca) was a Roman philosopher, playwright and senator. He is commonly associated with the emperor Caligula (as in the crazy one who was said to kill on a whim and be power obsessed) and Nero (as in the crazy one who "played a fiddle while watching Rome burn," which likely isn't true... but Nero really was crazy). Somewhere in his 30s, he became a senator in Rome and was said to be a talented orator-- so talented and charismatic, in fact, that some others began to resent and fear him (including Caligula). After Caligula's death, he was sentenced to death for an alleged affair by the then Empress Messsalina, a sentence which was commuted to being exiled by the then Emperor Claudius. After about ten years of exile, Claudius' new wife Aggripina convinced him to not just recall Seneca to Rome, but to offer him a praetorship (a very big deal position, one of two very powerful praetors) and to appoint Seneca as tutor to their newborn son, Nero.

Seneca served as Nero's tutor and advisor for 8 years, doing his best to mentor and reel in the unpredictable youth-then-emperor. Unfortunately, this didn't work out great; in 62AD, Nero accused Seneca of being part of a plot to assassinate him, ordering Seneca to commit suicice by punishment. Despite likely being innocent, Seneca went through with it. Nero was pretty nuts.

Seneca was a prolific writer his whole life, producing many popular plays. His renditions of Phaedra, Medea and Thyestes remain popular in Classical theater today.

### Pt II -- What school of philosophy is Seneca the Younger commonly associated with?

Seneca is commonly associated with the school of philosophy called Stoicism. 

### Pt III -- Stoicism in One (Long) Sentence

Grossly oversimplified, Stoicism focuses on the idea of virtue as the only universally morally good thing and true source of happiness, and that to be virtuous one should not be overly influenced by emotion or desire and instead act rationally, justly and fairly in the moment to moment.
